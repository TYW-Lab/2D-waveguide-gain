This repository is based on the source code for [1]. Its purpose is to implement saturable gain using realistic models and parameters.

The code is designed to run in a Jupyter notebook environment.

Python version: Python 3.11.9
Packages used are in requirements.txt. To install them all at once, run something like
pip install -r requirements.txt

Currently, only one of the Jupyter Notebook files in the examples folder is in use: beam propagation through realistically pixelated index profiles-test.ipynb

This notebook has been rewritten. Tasks done in it include: 

- Reproducing plots in Scaling on-chip photonic neural processors using arbitrarily programmable wave propagation. Its purpose is to implement saturable gain using realistic models and parameters.
- Designing a simple lens
- Testing optical gain by directly setting the imaginary part of delta_n to negative
- Testing the newly implemented model that updates both the real and imaginary parts of n as a function of injected current and optical power (still in progress. see the notebook for details)

The notebook imports from two custom Python files made by the authors of [1]: simulation.py and DMD_patterns.py
simulation.py initiates the waveguide objects and runs the simulation. DMD_patterns.py helps with simulating the creation of DMD (Digital Micromirror Device) patterns, which will be mapped to the waveguide to induce refractive index changes.

I heavily modified simulation.py to include a new class called "Material", which takes material parameters and returns the change in refractive index (both real and imaginary parts) as a function of injected current. I also made many changes to the existing WaveguideSimulation class to make sure it integrates properly with the Material class.

Both WaveguideSimulation and Material still require many changes before they can be used effectively. WaveguideSimulation has problems such as deprecation warnings, unintuitive parameter names, and a lack of comments. The Material class sometimes triggers a "divide by zero" warning, causing the simulation to fail. The simulation result also looks problematic because its delta_n map includes unexpectedly high values of delta_n.

I will attempt to solve these problems during the week of 12/19/2024

# Source code for: Scaling on-chip photonic neural processors using arbitrarily programmable wave propagation

## Overview
We propose and demonstrate a device, a *2D-programmable waveguide* whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the device [1]. We trained the device with a hybrid in-situ, in-silico backpropagation algorithm [2] to perform neural network inference. In particular, we achieved 96\% accuracy on vowel classification and 86\% accuracy on $7 \times 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification, with no trained digital-electronic pre- or post-processing.

In this repository, we provide the source code used to generate the results in our paper, written in Python and utilizing the PyTorch library for machine learning tasks. Designed for execution in a Jupyter notebook environment, this repository includes source code for simulations and experiments. Primarily intended for internal use, the code lacks detailed documentation, and the experimental portion presupposes connectivity to specific experimental devices, such as spatial-light modulators and cameras. The simulation code is self-contained and should run on system. The repository's primary contents are the source code alongside several usage examples. Data and code used to generate the figures of the paper will shortly be made accessible in the Zenodo repository [3]. For users interested in using this code or with inquiries, please feel free to contact us via the email addresses listed in the paper.
